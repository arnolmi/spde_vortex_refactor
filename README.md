# spde_vortex_refactor

You'll want to edit underdamped.py with your grid size and dt.  plot_vortexes needs to be run in whichever directory your angles are in.

step 1: run underdamped.py
step 2: run compute_angles.py
step 3: run plot_vortexes.py

Note:
compute_angles (this is done in a rather stupid way atm, however, if you run out of memory, change the number of workers in the pool (it looks something like p = Pool(10).
